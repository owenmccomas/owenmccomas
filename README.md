Welcome to my GitHub profile

I am a full stack student with a passion for web development and a drive to constantly improve my skills.

I have experience with a variety of technologies, including:

JavaScript (React, Node.js)
HTML/CSS
Git and version control

I am always looking for new projects to work on and new technologies to learn. Check out my repositories to see some of my work, and feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate on a project or have any questions!
